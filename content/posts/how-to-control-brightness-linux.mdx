If you're like me and work in a space where the amount of sunlight fluctuates drastically throughout the day, then it's likely you're constantly adjust your monitors brightness to compensate. 

Turns out it's really simple to control the brightness of your monitor from the command line without having to muck with the OSD. I have specific increments aliased for quick use.

I use a 27" 4k Dell (U2723QE) monitor connected via thunderbolt to my Dell Precision 5570 laptop.

## ddccontrol

There are likely others, but I found this tool worked well for me. The full installation instructions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ddccontrol/ddccontrol). I'm using a flavour of Ubuntu (Pop!_OS) so I use apt.

This tool changes the brightness of the monitor **at the hardware level** and I've seen a lot of other methods that just use software to effectively 'dim' the screen which is not what I wanted.

```bash
sudo apt install ddccontrol ddccontrol-db i2c-tools
```

__*You might need to restart your system after installing i2c-tools.__

Once installed, give it a shot by running the following command to probe for your monitor:

```bash
sudo ddccontrol -p
```

The output should contain some information about the device identifier, and the value that aligns with brightness control.

```bash {6,16}
Detected monitors :
 - Device: dev:/dev/i2c-12
   DDC/CI supported: No
   Monitor Name: VESA standard monitor
   Input type: Digital
 - Device: dev:/dev/i2c-16 # <-- my external monitor
   DDC/CI supported: Yes
   Monitor Name: VESA standard monitor
   Input type: Digital
  (Automatically selected)

...

Controls (valid/current/max) [Description - Value name]:
...
Control 0x10: +/50/100 C [Brightness]

```

I received a warning but was able to safely ignore it and move on.

<ErrorText>There is no support for your monitor in the database, but ddccontrol is using a basic generic profile</ErrorText>

`dev:/dev/i2c-12` is my external monitor, and `0x10` is the control we are targeting.

To read the monitors current brightness value (percentage), use the `-r` flag:

```bash
sudo ddccontrol -r 0x10 dev:/dev/i2c-16
```

 To write the monitors brightness level, use the `-w` flag:

```bash
 sudo ddccontrol -r 0x10 -w 85 dev:/dev/i2c-16
 ```

 ## Alias

I like my monitor brightness to be very low in the morning when I wake up, and I crank it up higher when the sunlight finds its way into my office in the afternoons.

I added a few alias commands to my `.bashrc` file to quickly toggle between 10%, 50%, and 85% brightness:

```bash:.bashrc
alias b10='sudo ddccontrol -r 0x10 -w 10 dev:/dev/i2c-16 > /dev/null 2>&1'
alias b50='sudo ddccontrol -r 0x10 -w 50 dev:/dev/i2c-16 > /dev/null 2>&1'
alias b85='sudo ddccontrol -r 0x10 -w 85 dev:/dev/i2c-16 > /dev/null 2>&1'
```

I added [> /dev/null 2>&1](https://askubuntu.com/a/474566/922639) to prevent all the warning messages from being dumped to the screen.
