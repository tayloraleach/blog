Debugging complicated CSS [z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) issues on your website can be difficult and time consuming, but luckily there is a handy developer tool to help isolate nested stacking contexts and visualize the layers in a 3D view.

## Layers Panel in Chrome

As of this writing, it seems that Chrome is [considering deprecating](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/328948996) the Layers panel but I really wanted to play with this feature so this gave me an excuse to download the Microsoft Edge browser.

## 3D View in Edge

- Press `ctrl+shift+P` (`cmd+shift+P` on macOS) to bring up the command palette
- Type "3D View" and select 3D View
- Select `Z-index` tab from the sidebar


You will be able to pan and scroll around a 3D representation of your website. You can hover over elements and see where elements might be overlapping in ways you did not expect. I found this particularly useful when creating elements with click masks or just in general when working with deeply nested absolutely positioned elements.
