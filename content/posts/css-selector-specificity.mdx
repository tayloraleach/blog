CSS selector specificity is a set of rules used to determine what styles get applied to what elements on the page. Each has a weight which you can use to calculate what will take priority.

| Selector Type             | Weight |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Inline styles             | 1-0-0-0|
| ID selectors              | 1-0-0  |
| Class selectors           | 0-1-0  |
| Attribute selectors       | 0-1-0  |
| Pseudo-classes            | 0-1-0  |
| Type selectors            | 0-0-1  |
| Pseudo-elements           | 0-0-1  |
| Universal selector (*)    | 0      |

### **Inline styles** have the highest weight and will always overrule any selectors. (1-0-0-0) 

The only way to override an inline style is by using `important!`

```html:html
<p style="color: tomato;">hello world</p>
```

### ID

ID selectors have the highest weight of any selector (1-0-0)

```css:css
#card { ... }
```

### CLASS

Class, attribute, and pseudo-class selectors all have medium weight (0-1-0)

```css:css
.element { ... }
input[type='submit'] { ... }
input:checked { ... }
```

### TYPE

Type and pseudo-element selectors are the lowest weight (0-0-1)

```css:css
p { ... }
p::before { ... }
```

_Double colons (::) are used for pseudo-elements. This distinguishes pseudo-elements from pseudo-classes that use single colon (:) in their notation_

When multiple conflicting styles are defined, the browser determines which style to apply based on the 
specificity of the selectors. If two or more conflicting styles have the same specificity, 
the one defined later in the CSS document or with a higher specificity in the cascade takes precedence.
